# ToolBox 🛠️

Welcome to ToolBox! This project gathers my sketches, initial projects, tests, and stages of learning to progressively master various technologies and programming languages before embarking on more advanced side projects.

## 😎 About

ToolBox is a personal repository where I explore and experiment with different tools, libraries, frameworks, and languages. The goal is to acquire new skills, test ideas, and consolidate my knowledge before applying these skills in more complex projects.

## 📂 Content

The repository contains code examples and demonstration projects covering various domains:

- **Programming languages**: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, etc.
- **Web technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, etc.).
- **Software development**: Scripts, automation, CLI tools, etc.
- **Databases**: SQL, NoSQL, database integration.
- **Other**: Explorations of new libraries and emerging tools.

## 🗂️ Organization

The various projects are organized into subfolders by theme or technology. Each subfolder contains a specific README.md file that explains the project's purpose, instructions for running it, and any other relevant information.

## 🚀 Usage

These projects are primarily intended for learning and experimentation. They can serve as a reference or inspiration for other developers looking to explore the same technologies.

## 🤝 Contribution

Contributions are not expected, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
